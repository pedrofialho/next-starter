# next-starter

This is a _pretty opinionated_, some-batteries-included [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), of course
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for cross-editor coding style consistency
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code quality
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as CSS framework
- [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) for merging class lists and optimizing Tailwind styling
- [zod](https://zod.dev) for schema validation/parsing
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) for date manipulation
- [T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/docs/recipes) for environment variables
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) for icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed; you can also install it [via a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#readme). Check your installation in a terminal with:

```bash
node --version
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## VS Code Extensions and Settings

This template includes extensions and settings recommendations to enhance the development experience with VS Code.

You can browse and enable recommended extensions for VS Code with the `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions` command.

Copy `.vscode/settings.recommended.json` to `.vscode/settings.json` to use recommended optimal settings like format/lint on save and other niceties.

## Configuration

The linter/formatter configuration is pretty great out of the box, but if needed it can be tailored to your needs with these configuration files:

- `.editorconfig` - Customize core editor options like charset, EOL, indent type/size, etc. View [EditorConfig Properties](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties) for more info;
- `.prettier.config.cjs` - Customize advanced formatting rules. View [Prettier Docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) for more info.
- `.eslintrc.cjs` - Customize static analysis rules. View [ESLint Rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) for more info.

## Next Steps

This project doesn't include many great libraries that _could_ be useful for certain projects with specific needs. Also some things are trivial to install/configure and the goal here is not to save people from a 5-minute installation guide. That said, here's a list of recommendations for expanding this setup:

- [React Query/TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) is great for server state/asynchronous state management. Check their [Advanced Server Rendering](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/advanced-ssr) guide to learn more about whether it's a good fit for what you're building. Also don't miss out on their [ESLint plugin](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/eslint/eslint-plugin-query)!

## Learn More about Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
